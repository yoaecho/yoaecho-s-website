    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
    <p id="first" class="myclass">
      <span class="special underline">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a stylesheet language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
    </p>
    
    <h2>CSS Ruleset</h2>
    <p class="green">
      CSS rules is composed of a <span>selector</span> and a <span>declaration block</span>. The declaration block can have one or multiple <span>declarations</span>. Each declaration has a <span>property</span> and its <span>value</span>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Selector</h3>
    <p class="underline">
      This is used to select the element(s) you want to style. In this example, we are selecting all the p elements in the HTML document.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="green">Declaration Block</h3>
    <article>
      <p>
        A selector is followed by a declaration block. The curly braces { } defines the beginning and ending of a declaration block.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <h3>Declaration</h3>
    <p style="width:80%">
      <em>Declarations <span>should</span> be put Inside the curly braces.</em> They can define how the selected HTML element will be displayed. Each declaration ends with a semicolon ;.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>
      The first part of a declaration (before the colon : ) defines which property of the selected element you want to style. In this example, we are changing the color of all the p elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      See a list of CSS properties here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp</a>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Property Value</h3>
    <p id="last" >
      To the right of the property (after the colon : ) is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. In this example, the color of the p elements will be displayed red, which is one of the many values that can be applied to the color property.
