        <p>The journal of the Comb analyzes the respondents' information and the comb length, width, comb tooth spacing/angle used. It records the unique language produced by the five interviewees themselves and the comb, reshaping the comb as an activator of a new dialogue form. This language seems to come from the poetry that the comb praises when it combines with people, attempting to explore the deeper meaning of the "comb" item to individuals in different dimensions.</p>
