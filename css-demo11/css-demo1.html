    <h2>《The journey of the Comb》</h2>
    <p class="green">
      As a private and intimate item, the comb seems to be limited in our imagination in daily life, and we only consider it as a 'comb'. When we re examine it, each comb carries an independent emotional narrative.
      <br>  The journal of the Comb analyzes the respondents' information and the comb length, width, comb tooth spacing/angle used. It records the unique language produced by the five interviewees themselves and the comb, reshaping the comb as an activator of a new dialogue form. This language seems to come from the poetry that the comb praises when it combines with people, attempting to explore the deeper meaning of the "comb" item to individuals in different dimensions.<br>
